# Inline vs. Block

## What is a Block Element?
- Take up the full width of their parent element
- Stack vertically, on top of each other
- Will always start a new line

### Examples
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<div>`
- `<section>`
- `<main>`
- `<article>`

## What is an Inline Element?
- Don't start new lines
- Only take up as much horizontal space as their content
- Also flow within the contents of their parents

### Examples
- `<span>`
- `<img>`
- `<button>`
- `<label>`
- `<input>`
- `<a>`
