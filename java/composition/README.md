# Composition

Prioritise composition over object-oriented programming. This is because of the platypus problem. Composition is more scalable and prevents you from making classes for each entity you want to create. This is the approach of game development.

All about separating logic and data. The classes and interfaces you build to implement composition store the data.

The point of composition is to not make a specific model for every single object you want to create. For example, you can just have a composition class `Vehicle` which has the properties found across all vehicles like cars, vehicles, bikes, motorbikes.

Data-driven programming (DDP) is a completely different paradigm and is much more flexible than object-oriented programming (OOP). The object is defined by its data, rather than the class name like in OOP.

You don't see a DDP in web development because it doesn't require it.

Examples to do to practise DDP:

- Vehicles
- Furniture
