.git is the local repository, a file that accumulates the 
	changes that we're not ready to send to the remote 
	repository

git init adds the .git file
git add <file, directory, or .>
git commit -m "message"
git branch -M main renames the default branch to main
git push origin main

SSH key is one for each device you use
