# Interviews

- Usually online now

## Non-Negotiables

- Camera is working and angled well, eye-level
  - If you have a standing desk, stand!
- Microphone is working and sounds good
- Clean/blurred/virtual background (at least one of these)
  - Don't have anything moving in your background like a TV or something walking past behind you; it's distracting
- Nicer than usual clothes
  - Don't have to wear a suit
  - A lot of developer jobs you're wearing casual clothes, but during the interview look presentable
- Be in a calm and quiet environment to remove any distractions

## Your Introduction

1. Talk about yourself and your background
2. Talk about the reason why you decided to move into technology

- I like to solve things
- I like to build things
- I like to design things

3. Talk about your experience at \_nology

- What you learnt
- What you built
- What was your biggest win

4. What have you been doing?

- What projects have you been working on?
- Backing up your enthusiasm for technology
- When you're proud of a project, it's so much easier to talk about

Points 2 and 4 are the most important.

## Talking About Projects

- Be proud and excited about your work!
- T-shaped
  - You'll know the most about the recent one
  - The more recent ones will be more challenging
- Don't minimise your work
  - Don't use softening language (sort of, kind of, it half works)
  - Web development is hard, difficult technology stacks are being used!
- Have the demo you want to show ready, especially when your interview is 45 minutes
  - Make it look professional and polished, the code doesn't need to be the best yet
  - Should run when you boot up your server
  - Make sure to **not have console errors**
  - Make sure the application you're demoing is **complete**
  - Simple and complete is better than complex and half done
  - Complete the MVP

## Being Personable

- This is a learned skill
- Active listening
  - Make eye contact, repeat things they have mentioned back to them
- Latch onto threads of conversation
- Leave threads for them to engage in too

  - Always give a chance for them to jump in
- Give an opportunity to be nerdy and talk about their interests
  - People love to talk about themselves
  - People also love to share their opinions
  - Talking about this stuff lets you humble brag and showcase your knowledge subtly
- Intonation, speed of speech, body language
  - Excitable speech (proud, excited, amazing, loved)
  - Show and sound enthusiastic!
- People that are fun and have an infectious energy are less likely to get ridden of
- Humble brag

## Technical Skills

- Practise doing stuff live with an audience
  - If you can't find an audience, record it!

  - Don't be too embarrassed if you forget something, graciously ask!
- Getting something wrong isn't the end of the world
  - They want to see your limit
  - They want to see how you handle not knowing something
- Practise!
  - Codewars, HackerRank, etc.
- If you don't know how to do something after the interview was finished, follow up with them to get the answer
- Follow up email
  - Ask about something you couldn't do
  - Send better solutions to technology tests, etc.

## Q & A
- Short answers vs. live code?
  - Mix of both
  - Technology literacy is important
