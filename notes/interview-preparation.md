# Interview Preparation

- Do not expect the interviewer to be specialised in the field

## Questions

- Be prepared
- You need to show and say what is unique about yourself
- Sometimes you'll have a technical and non-technical interviewer, so you need to balance your answers

- Tell us about yourself
  - What is personal enough to make a connection, look at their LinkedIn beforehand to see what they're posting about and make an anchor
  - Say something that you can also pivot to show your skills and value
- Tell us about your experience
  - Place them in a sequence to make it more understandable
  - End with the "and the role that I'm going for..."
- What do you know about this role?
- What do you know about the company?
  - You should know this from research such as via LinkedIn and their website
  - Connect on what you know about the company to further connection between you and the company
- Why does this role appeal to you?
- What are your strengths?
  - "Well, what I have found is..."
    - Start with this to lead into the answers

  - What do people think you're really good at? And why do they say this?
    - Use this to help create an answer
- What are your weaknesses?
  - Tell me a time you made a mistake?

- Tell us about something you have accomplished you are proud of
- Tell us about the most challenging technical problem you have solved
- Tell us about a time when you have disagreed with a colleague and how that issue was resovled
