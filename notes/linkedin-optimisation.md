- Change profile photo

- List your licenses and certifications
- List and engage in volunteer engagements
- Only ask for recommendations from people you've had direct relations with

  - If someone won't give you a LinkedIn recommendation, don't ask them to be a reference on your resume, because they don't want to say anything about you on an open forum

How to leverage LinkedIn
Do this for all the companies or jobs you're going for.

1. Company


    - What are they posting about?
      - What has the most likes and what's the most recent posts?
      - Find something you resonate with
      - Find something you and the company are both compassionate about
        - When they are asking why you want to join them, they're really asking if you're one of them

2. People


    - Who do you know from organisation?
    - Ask people who you know who have connections with the organisation
    - What is it like to work there?
    - Ask if they have a referral system
    - Find out more about the role and who you're being interviewed by

3. Job


    - Click on the employees number
    - Who else has held this role before?
      - How do they describe it?
      - Where did they come from?
      - What are they doing now?
      - Are you connected?
      - Take a look at past employees and what they've worked at beforehand
        -

4. Interview


    - Who is interviewing you?
      - If they don't tell you who, ask
    - What is their job title?
    - What do you think they care about?
    - Are you connected?

You can frame your answers better when you ask yourself why they want to know what they're asking.

Bring value to your team, make your team move faster, basically a low maintenance employee (but word it more nicely).

Other people care whether you represent a profile of a good candidate. Do you appear like others that managers have accepted into your role before? Will you be a good cultural fit?

Growth mindset, not a know-it-all, but rather a learn-it-all.
