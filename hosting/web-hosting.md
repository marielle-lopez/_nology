# Web Hosting

A service that allows individuals and organisations to make their website accessible on the Internet. It's a crucial aspect of building and maintaining a website as it provides the necessary infrastructure and support for the website to be accessed by users around the world.

When a website is created, it is built using a combination of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's stored on a computer or a server. In order for a website to be accessible on the Internet, it needs to be hosted on a server that is connected to the Internet. This is where web hosting comes in.

If you're looking for a reliable and consistent web host, look at [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com) or [bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com). Web hosters provide servers that can store and manage websites, and they also provide the necessary technical support and maintenance to ensure your website is always up and running.

## Types of Web Hosting

There are several types of web hosting, each with their own unique features and benefits.

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is the most basic and affordable type of web hosting. In shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on a single server, and the resources of the server are shared among all the websites. This is a great option for small businesses and personal websites that don't have a lot of traffic or require a lot of resources.

### VPS Hosting

VPS hosting is a more advanced type of web hosting that provides greater control and flexibility.

In VPS hosting, a website is hosted on a virtual server which is a partition of a physical server. This allows each website to have its own dedicated resources and it also provides more control over the server, making it a great option for websites that have higher traffic or more demanding requirements.

### Dedicating Hosting

[Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com) does not provide dedicating hosting, but [bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com) does. This is the most advanced and expensive type of web hosting.

In dedicated hosting, a website is hosted on its own physical server. This provides the greatest level of control and resources, making it a great option for very large businesses or websites that receive a lot of traffic. This is why it's a very expensive option.

### Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting is a newer type of web hosting that's becoming increasingly popular. A website is hosted on a network of servers that are connected to the Internet. This provides greater scalability and flexibility as the website can automatically use more resources as needed.

### Others

In addition to the web hosting types mentioned above, you also have e-commerce hosting and WordPress hosting. These are more specialised types of web hosting. There are even more types depending on the web hoster you're looking at.
